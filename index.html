                                <p> Welcome to my blog. I am a cybersecurity analyst 
                                    and instructor.
                                    I have a special interest in Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), and I have 
                                    been involved with the training of international 
                                    cybersecurity and DFIR students through my full time job
                                    , but also for a US based organization focused on DFIR 
                                    instruction for law enforcement officers. I am also a freelance IT and cybersecurity writer. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In addition to red teaming, I have been trained 
                                    in DFIR and incident response, as well as malware
                                    incident response.

                                    I currently teach programs in Python, PowerShell,
                                    Linux and Windows administration, including centralized
                                    management, as well as networking basics and network

                            <h2 class="display-6"> Using Terraform to Automate a Red Team Infrastructure Build
                                Inside a Cloud Based Virtual Machine</h2>
                            <p class="lead">We will be using Terraform, an infrastructure as a code service, directly
                                from the command line (cmd on Windows 10 in my case) on our local machine (host or VM),
                                to to automate our red team infrastructure build in an Amazon
                                Web Services (AWS) Linux virtual machine. This infrastructure can be easily built and
                                destroyed from the command line using Terraform. In our AWS virtual private cloud (VPC),
                                we will create a Linux EC2 virtual machine instance,
                                which will host our entire infrastructure (Caldera-C2, Evilginx2, Gophish, and Socat
                                redirector). This is achieved by utilizing a Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL)
                                file, that is run directly from our command line (the
                                Terraform CLI has to be installed from the Terraform website). Using this method we can
                                simplify our infrastructure build, saving us time, streamlining the process, and setting
                                ourselves up for version control of our code
                                as necessary. The HCL file can be edited using the code editor of your choice, and
                                tracked for version control using the version control system (VCS) of your choice. Using
                                infrastructure as a code in this way is an elegant
                                and efficient way of managing your red team infrastructure.

                            <p class="lead">I have created a local folder for each of my phishing domains that I have
                                registered in AWS using Route-53, with the zone-id variable in the HCL file set to the
                                zone-id that has been assigned to that domain in AWS Route-53. These
                                HCL files will can be managed using a version control system (GitHub in my case), which
                                makes it easy to keep track of changes to the infrastructure, as well as to branch and
                                modify the file for use in different phishing
                                domains.

                            <h2 class="display-6">What Is Terraform?</h2>
                            <p class="lead">
                                Terraform is an open-source, infrastructure as code software tool, that provides a
                                consistent command line interface workflow to manage multiple cloud services. Terraform
                                codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files. You use it directly
                                from your command line on your machine to automate your cloud infrastructure builds.</p>

                                The cloud provides us with the optimal platform in terms of reliability for hosting our
                                command and control server, along with the rest of our infrastructure. All the
                                infrastructure required for registering domains and configuration of DNS records for
                                our use is readily available using AWS Route-53. The cloud provider IP addresses
                                associated with the red team infrastructure VM are trusted because they are associated
                                with AWS, and are not likely to raise suspicion. If
                                internal IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection System / Intrusion Prevention System), or an
                                actual human performs a DNS lookup, an AWS IP address range will be returned. It is
                                common for most modern enterprises to utilise a cloud
                                service provider to host services and applications, as well as for databases. The
                                services and applications that we interact with on a daily basis are hosted mostly, if
                                not completely, on one of the available cloud service
                                providers (this may be a hybrid cloud - combination of site based and cloud based
                                services). As a red team service provider, we are no different, and using the cloud to
                                host our infrastructure in this manner is a best practice.
                                Using a cloud service provider ensures that our command and control server is ready at
                                all times to receive a connection when a target is successfully exploited and begins
                                beaconing. Public IP addresses associated with
                                the VPC instance are re-created every time the VM is destroyed and re-created (the
                                process is straightforward using Terraform), meaning that if the target becomes
                                suspicious, the machine can be easily destroyed using the
                                "terraform destroy" command, and rebuilt immediately using the "terraform plan" and
                                "terraform apply" commands, thereby changing the public IP addresses associated with the
                                VPC instance. The cloud also gives flexibility
                                in terms of multiple IP addresses, and multiple machines for a bigger infrastructure. We
                                are using AWS, but there are many other options available.

                            <p class="lead">The process begins by creating an AWS account. In AWS, the infrastructure as
                                a service virtual machine and VPC service is called EC2. here you can create a new EC2
                                instance, and configure it to run the command and control server.
                                We have chosen an AWS linux VM (t4g.micro) that is available on free tier, and we set up
                                our VPC. Our Terraform HCL file will create this infrastructure when we run it from our
                                command line. For two factor authentication
                                of my AWS account I use a FIDO U2F zero trust security key.
